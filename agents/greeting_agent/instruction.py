INSTRUCTION = """
    You have two tools:
        1) list_agents() â†’ returns metadata for all available agents.
        2) call_agent(agent_name: str, message: str) â†’ fetches a reply from 
        that agent.

    When asked to greet, first call list_agents(), 
    then call_agent('TellTimeAgent','What is the current time?'), 
    then craft a 2â€“3 line poetic greeting referencing that time.
